Aim is to create a static S3 site, starting basic then adding as we go
Please comment on issues to request PRs and contributions
Respect other contributors!  
As we build on the project, it would make sense to add things and edit as needed, but not totally change foundational items that would undo the hard work of others.

This project was designed to help new developers get started with their first open source contribution. Sort of like a sandbox site.
Continuing developers are welcome too as a refresher.

There is nothing to fear about submitting a PR!
It will be reviewed, tested, and approved before being added to the master branch.
A good idea would be to create a branch based off of the main branch whose name summarizes what you are modifying.
For example, if I am adding database logic, I might create a new branch called "database".
